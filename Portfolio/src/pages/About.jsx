      <p>
        I would like to introduce myself as Sam, a dedicated individual who has recently embarked on a journey to acquire proficiency in coding and web development. Drawing upon my background in the fields of science, specifically biochemistry and molecular biology, I am now actively participating in a coding bootcamp at Monash University.

        The purpose of this intensive program is to equip me with the fundamental expertise necessary to pursue a new and promising career in the realm of information technology. In line with this endeavor, I have taken the initiative to construct a comprehensive portfolio that showcases my abilities and potential value to prospective employers in the field.
